# **3.0.3 - What's New?**

- üõ† **Improved Error Handling:**  
  The parser loop now gracefully continues on errors instead of breaking.  

- üåê **Custom User-Agent Support:**  
  Pass a custom `UserAgent` as props to tailor link previews to your needs.  

- üì∫ **New Helpers:**  
  Added YouTube video and redirection helpers for smoother handling of specific links.  

- üöÄ **Enhanced Metadata Fetching:**  
  The `getMetadata()` function now supports a `userAgent` option for more flexible metadata retrieval.

# 3.0.2

**New Features:**

- **SVG Icon Support:** AnyLinkPreview now seamlessly handles SVG images returned in metadata, enhancing support for various image formats.
- **New Metadata Property - `siteName`:** We've introduced a `siteName` property to our metadata fetch method, allowing for richer data extraction and display.

**Improvements:**

- **Enhanced `itemBuilder` Callback:** The `itemBuilder` property has been expanded to return an `SvgPicture` widget when metadata includes an SVG image. This ensures correct rendering of SVGs alongside standard image formats.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** When both title and description are missing from the metadata, AnyLinkPreview will now resort to displaying the `errorWidget` (if provided) or a default error view. This update ensures a smoother user experience by providing informative feedback in cases of incomplete metadata.
- **Extended Redirect Support:** To improve handling of server-driven redirects, AnyLinkPreview now supports up to 7 redirects, accommodating common status codes `301, 302, 303, 307, 308`. This enhancement ensures more reliable URL preview generation across a wider range of web links.

# 2.0.5

- FIX: <b>Twitter link preview</b>. Twitter uses client-side-rendering (CSR) to generate HTML in the browser
  - Viewing the source directly will not show any of the relevant <meta> tags or actual page HTML content, because it is all dynamically generated on the client's browser in React using JavaScript (i.e. CSR: Client-side rendering). In fact, the HTML source will have a stub containing "We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter?". This can be verified by opening up developer tools and peeking at the "Elements" tab during page load/render or downloading the page without JavaScript emulation
  - However, to improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for various prominent web-crawlers, Twitter will instead return server-side-rendered (SSR) HTML content (which does contain the `<meta>` tags). This enables crawlers to not have to emulate JavaScript to view the page, and only crawl raw HTML content. Twitter recognizes crawlers based on the supplied User-Agent HTTP Header. Server-side-rendering is generally a more expensive operation than offloading the HTML rendering onto the client, which may be a reason why Twitter opts for client-side-rendering as the default behavior.

# 2.0.4

- Proxy URL added for CORS issue on the web. One can pass empty if they don't get any CORS issue while running on web platform.
- Now one can disable the `onTap` action on the card by passing empty function `onTap: (){}`
- If you want to build your own UI & need just the meta data (with or without cache), then you can call the method `AnyLinkPreview.getMetadata(link: "https://google.com/")` which returns data of type `Metadata`
- One can check if the URL is valid or not by calling `AnyLinkPreview.isValidLink("https://google.com/")` which returns a boolean. `true` if `Valid`, `false` if `Invalid`.
